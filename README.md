# An Interesting Article I Read

[Link to Article: _Software Engineer Careers: A Complete Guide_](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/it-and-tech/software-engineering-careers/)

One aspect that the article elaborated on that intrigued me was the idea of how labels like "software developer" and "software engineer" actually have little meaning in the grand scheme of what it means to work in this industry. Contrary to how the public divides the creation of software into development and engineering, the article claims that the main distinction in careers related to software are application development and systems engineering. This distinction comes from the needs and the key skills required to work in either of these fields. For instance, those in application development may be more focused on the __client__, while systems developers are responsible for the clean functioning of software programs together.
